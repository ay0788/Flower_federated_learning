# 🌼 Federated Learning with Flower

Welcome to the **Flower Federated Learning Project**! This repository demonstrates the implementation of a federated learning system using the [Flower framework](https://flower.dev/). Federated learning enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while ensuring data privacy.

## 🚀 Features

- **Privacy-Preserving Training**: Train models without sharing raw data.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the code for different machine learning models and datasets.
- **Scalable**: Supports various scenarios from small setups to large-scale federated systems.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flower (`pip install flwr`)
- Other dependencies (see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt))

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Flower_federated_learning.ipynb`: Main notebook for federated learning experiments.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required libraries.
- Additional files and resources for running the project.

## 📖 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-federated-learning.git
   cd flower-federated-learning
